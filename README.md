Welcome to Mealio! This project is a vanilla JavaScript web application that allows you to search for meals, save your favorite ones, and view detailed information about each meal. Below are the key features of this app:

Key Features :-
Real-time Search: The app allows you to search for meals, and as you type, suggestions are dynamically loaded in real-time based on your input.

Favorite Meals: Each search result displays a "favorite" button. Clicking on this button will add the meal to your "Favorite Meals" list.

Meal Page: When you click on any specific search result (meal), a new page will open up, providing more detailed information about that meal, including its name, photo, instructions, and other relevant details.

Persistent Favorites: The app ensures that your list of favorite meals remains persistent even after closing or refreshing the browser. You will find the same number of favorite meals as before.

Favorite Meals Page: The app provides a separate page to display all your favorite meals in a list format.

Remove from Favorites: On the "Favorite Meals" page, each meal has a "liked" status indicator. Clicking on this indicator will remove the meal from your favorites list.

Optimized Logic and Styling: The development process involved 2 days of work on implementing the logic and styling of the app. Special attention has been given to improve performance, including the application of a debounce function to handle search input efficiently.

Reduced Redundancy and Documentation: An additional day was dedicated to debugging, reducing redundancy in the code, and ensuring comprehensive documentation to make the project maintainable and easy to understand.

Fun and Learning Experience: The development journey of this project was enjoyable, and I learned a lot in the process. One possible side effect of working on this app is becoming extremely hungry while looking at all the delicious food! üòÑ
